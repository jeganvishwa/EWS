      "reason": "1. Kamarajar Nagar in Adyar is located at the junction of Lattice Bridge Road (LB Road) and Thiruvalluvar Salai (ECR) and consists of three streets. Geographically, it is at a lower elevation than the surrounding areas, which causes waterlogging issues, particularly in the Second and Third streets, even during mild rain. During heavy rainfall, the waterlogging extends to neighboring streets.\n2. However, during intense rainfall on October 15, 2024, the drainage system on LB Road reached full capacity, causing stagnation.",
      "solution": "1. One of the contributing factors is the storm water drain (SWD) system in Kamarajar Nagar, which connects to Thiruvalluvar Salai and further to LB Road, where there is a mismatch in the stormwater invert levels. To address this, a pump with a sump was recently constructed at the junction of Thiruvalluvar Salai (ECR) and Kamarajar Nagar under the direction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Additionally, a wall was built at the end of Kamarajar Nagar’s Second Street to prevent backflow, and a separate pipeline was installed to direct rainwater from Kamarajar Nagar to LB Road via the pump.\n2. However, during intense rainfall on October 15, 2024, the drainage system on LB Road reached full capacity, causing stagnation. The wall at the end of Kamarajar Nagar’s Second Street was dismantled, and rainwater had to be pumped out to the LB Road SWD using a 20 HP pump.\n3. Now it is proposed to manage the situation with additional pumping arrangements. \n4. It is also proposed to construct a separate culvert to divert water from Thiruvalluvar Salai to West Avenue via LB Road. This is necessary because the invert level of LB Road is higher than that of Thiruvalluvar Salai, which has been contributing to waterlogging issues. By creating this separate culvert, the large volume of water from the Thiruvalluvar Salai catchment can be diverted independently, rather than relying on the existing culvert, which has limited capacity.",

However, this has led to severe inundation issues on Five Furlong Road during heavy rains.\n\nIIT & Raj Bhavan:\nRainwater from the IIT campus and Raj Bhavan primarily flows through an existing channel that begins at Periyar Salai (IIT Park). This channel consists of a 400-meter concrete section and a 580-meter section with Hume pipes, ending at the B Canal through the TNRDC culvert. However, the current setup is inadequate to handle the large volume of rainwater. \n\nAdditionally, there is an invert level mismatch between the GCC drain and the TNRDC culvert.\n\nDuring heavy rains, the water level in the B Canal rises, obstructing the water flow.",
      "solution": "Five Furlong Road:\nSeveral instructions and notices were issued to the MRC, directing them to manage rainwater on their property by constructing ponds, implementing rainwater harvesting, and preventing rainwater from being discharged into the existing stormwater drain (SWD) on Five Furlong Road. \nThey were also advised to explore options for diverting excess rainwater to the Adyar River. Despite repeated directives, the MRC has not taken effective action.\nAs a result, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) entered the MRC premises after intimation. The GCC is now constructing new ponds . Also expanding cum deepening the existing ponds to mitigate flooding on Five Furlong Road.\n\nIIT & Raj Bhavan:\nAn estimate has been prepared, and a tender received to replace the Hume pipes with a concrete drain system, with a capacity recommended by IIT Madras, leading to the B Canal. Work is scheduled to begin after the North East Monsoon (NEM) in 2024.\n\nCurrently, the rainwater management is being handled through a pumping system with shutter arrangements at the B Canal, along with high-capacity pumps provided by CMRL.",
